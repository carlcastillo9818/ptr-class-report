# ptr-class-report

This program analyzes
a classroom of students and their test scores.
It reads in the student IDs and their test scores from a file.  
It calculates their averages then it displays
all of the IDs, test scores, and averages.  Next, it displays
only the averages that are greater than 70. Next, it
sorts the students based on their averages, then searches for
values of 85, and displays only the students IDs with averages 
equal to or greater than 85.  It sorts the students based on 
their IDs and then allows the user to request an ID
which is searched for.  Finally, the program displays the
requested students ID, their test scores, and average and
asks the user if they want to look for another students
ID or not.
